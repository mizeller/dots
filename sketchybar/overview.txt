How do I want my workspace to be structured?

For starters, let's use this setup (single, external monitor):

{
    1: VSCode. Current project.
    2: Ghostty & Vivaldi (work-related, half screen)
    3: Slack (Prob. add notion there as well)
    4: Spotify & Whatsapp (private)
    5: Vivaldi, full screen. research & work related
    ...
    ?N: Notion > to take notes & what not...
}
